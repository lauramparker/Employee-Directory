# Employee-Directory

<h3><u>Title: Employee-Directory<u></h3>
<h5><i>React JS<i></h5>

<h3>Description:</h3> 
    This project delivers a React JS app-- Employee Directory -- that allows a user to view a list of employees and dynamically search the directory.  The employee information is provided by third-party API, Random User, (whuch generates a random list of 50 employees each time the directory is run).
    The sample "Employee" information is presented in a table with first name, last name, country location, phone, cell, and email.  At the bottom of the table, the user can enter part of a name and the list will dynamically update to match the user's input.
